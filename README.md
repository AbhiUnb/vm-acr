Bilkul bhai. Ab main deta hoon enterprise-grade, detailed test cases for Azure Container Apps (ACA)â€”waise hi jaise maine Azure Web App ke liye diye the. This will help you validate production ACA deployments using Terratest or any IaC testing strategy.

âœ… 1. Infrastructure Provisioning and Resource Integrity

ðŸ”¸ TC-101: Confirm ACA Environment is Created
	â€¢	Objective: Ensure the ACA environment (used for networking and hosting) is provisioned correctly.
	â€¢	Why it matters: ACA environments are shared infrastructure; wrong setup breaks isolation.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Use az containerapp env show or Terraform output.
	â€¢	Confirm location, name, and infrastructureSubtype (e.g., managed vs connected).

â¸»

ðŸ”¸ TC-102: Validate Container App Instance Creation
	â€¢	Objective: Check that the container app resource exists and is tied to the correct environment.
	â€¢	Why it matters: If app is created outside the expected env, DNS and scaling may break.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Use az containerapp show and match environmentId.
	â€¢	Confirm name, location, and resource group.

â¸»

ðŸ”¸ TC-103: Validate Managed Identity Binding
	â€¢	Objective: Ensure the ACA has a user-assigned or system-assigned identity.
	â€¢	Why it matters: Identity is critical for secure access to Key Vault, storage, etc.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Use az containerapp identity show.
	â€¢	Assert identity is Enabled and the correct client IDs are listed.

âœ… 2. Networking and Ingress Validation

ðŸ”¸ TC-201: Validate Ingress Configuration
	â€¢	Objective: Ensure ingress is enabled/disabled as expected (public vs internal).
	â€¢	Why it matters: Misconfigured ingress can expose internal apps to public.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	az containerapp ingress show.
	â€¢	Assert targetPort, transport=auto, external=true/false.

â¸»

ðŸ”¸ TC-202: Verify Custom Domain and TLS Certificate (Optional)
	â€¢	Objective: Confirm that the app is bound to a custom domain with proper TLS certificate.
	â€¢	Why it matters: Domain & TLS config is critical for external access and security.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Use az containerapp hostname list.
	â€¢	Validate hostname, TLS issuer (Azure, BYOC, etc.), expiration.

â¸»

ðŸ”¸ TC-203: Validate VNET Injection (If Used)
	â€¢	Objective: Ensure ACA is deployed inside a subnet with correct delegated permissions.
	â€¢	Why it matters: Enterprises isolate traffic using VNETs and NSGs.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Check subnet config: az network vnet subnet show --query delegation.
	â€¢	Assert ACA can resolve internal endpoints using DNS.

â¸»

âœ… 3. Application Configuration and Image Validation

ðŸ”¸ TC-301: Validate Container Image Source
	â€¢	Objective: Ensure that the correct image (tagged version, registry) is deployed.
	â€¢	Why it matters: Wrong tag/image = stale or vulnerable code.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Use az containerapp revision list or az containerapp show --query template.containers.
	â€¢	Assert image name and tag match expected (acr.azurecr.io/api:v1.2.3).

â¸»

ðŸ”¸ TC-302: Validate Container Environment Variables
	â€¢	Objective: Check critical env vars like ENV, DEBUG, DB_URI, etc.
	â€¢	Why it matters: App wonâ€™t boot correctly without required env vars.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Use az containerapp revision show or Terraform output.
	â€¢	Assert presence and values of sensitive/non-sensitive env vars.

â¸»

ðŸ”¸ TC-303: Validate Secrets Injection via ACA
	â€¢	Objective: Ensure secrets are injected securely via secretRef and not hardcoded.
	â€¢	Why it matters: Security risk if secrets are in plaintext or Git.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Check secrets.name in az containerapp revision show.
	â€¢	Ensure no hardcoded credentials in env vars.

âœ… 4. Health, Scaling and Performance

ðŸ”¸ TC-401: Validate Health Probes and Liveness Checks
	â€¢	Objective: Ensure container has proper HTTP or TCP liveness/readiness probes.
	â€¢	Why it matters: Without probes, autoscaler and restarts may not work.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	az containerapp revision show â†’ livenessProbe, readinessProbe.
	â€¢	Hit /health or /status endpoint and validate 200 response.

â¸»

ðŸ”¸ TC-402: Validate Autoscaling Rules (KEDA-based)
	â€¢	Objective: Confirm autoscaler (KEDA) rules are in place for CPU, HTTP, or queue triggers.
	â€¢	Why it matters: Without autoscaling, apps may fail under load.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Use az containerapp show â†’ scale block.
	â€¢	Validate minReplicas, maxReplicas, rules.type (http, cpu, custom).

â¸»

ðŸ”¸ TC-403: Performance Baseline Validation
	â€¢	Objective: Simulate small load and validate response time.
	â€¢	Why it matters: Ensures app is not cold starting every request.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Use http_helper.HttpGetWithRetry(...) in Terratest.
	â€¢	Assert latency < 300ms for warmed app.

â¸»

âœ… 5. Security and Compliance

ðŸ”¸ TC-501: Validate Image Pull from Private ACR using Identity
	â€¢	Objective: Ensure ACA pulls image from private registry via managed identity.
	â€¢	Why it matters: Public access to ACR is a security risk.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	az containerapp registry list.
	â€¢	Confirm identity is used instead of username/password.

â¸»

ðŸ”¸ TC-502: Validate Diagnostic Logging to Log Analytics or Storage
	â€¢	Objective: Ensure logging is enabled and connected to central observability stack.
	â€¢	Why it matters: Logging is key for detection, compliance, and support.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Use az monitor diagnostic-settings list.
	â€¢	Assert metrics/logs for ACA are routed to Log Analytics.

â¸»

ðŸ”¸ TC-503: Validate Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
	â€¢	Objective: Confirm the right team has the correct IAM roles.
	â€¢	Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized changes or visibility.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	az role assignment list --scope /subscriptions/xxx/resourceGroups/xxx.
	â€¢	Validate roles like AcrPull, Contributor, Reader.

â¸»

âœ… 6. Terraform-Specific Validations

ðŸ”¸ TC-601: Plan Drift Validation
	â€¢	Objective: Ensure terraform plan is clean after apply (no drift).
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Run terraform plan in Terratest and parse output.
	â€¢	Assert output says No changes.

â¸»

ðŸ”¸ TC-602: Resource Teardown Completeness
	â€¢	Objective: Ensure terraform destroy removes ACA, environment, logs, VNET.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Destroy infra, then validate using Azure CLI that resources no longer exist.

âœ… Example: Go Test Case for ACA Ingress

appUrl := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "aca_url")
http_helper.HttpGetWithRetry(t, appUrl + "/health", nil, 200, "ok", 10, 5*time.Second)



â¸»

âœ… Bonus: CI/CD Test Case (Optional)

ðŸ”¸ TC-701: Validate Container App Deployment Triggered from Pipeline
	â€¢	Objective: Ensure pipeline correctly pushes latest container image on merge/deploy.
	â€¢	Why it matters: Detect CI/CD misconfigurations.
	â€¢	Validation Strategy:
	â€¢	Push a dummy tag vX.X.X-test.
	â€¢	Confirm it appears in az containerapp revision list.

Want Me To:
	â€¢	Generate a Go-based Terratest suite for ACA with test stages (setup, validate, teardown)?
	â€¢	Convert this to a Markdown or CSV test plan?
	â€¢	Show how to mock ACA outputs for Terratest offline testing?

Just let me know how youâ€™re building your pipeline (Terraform, GitHub Actions, etc.), and Iâ€™ll tailor it exactly.
